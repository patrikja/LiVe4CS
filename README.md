## Abstract

As the software surrounding us becomes more complex and is increasingly integrated into industry, commerce, transport, healthcare, government and society at large, so it becomes ever more important to provide guarantees about its safety, security and behaviour as a whole. Unfortunately, providing such guarantees is increasingly challenging: security must be balanced against usability; safety must be balanced against performance; responsiveness must be balanced against energy usage etc.  At the same time, testing and verifying that software meets all these conflicting demands is time-consuming, expensive, and often fails to spot critical issues. Fundamentally, we need new, lightweight mechanisms for verifying that software meets all of its requirements, both in terms of its functionality and in terms of its behaviour. This will enable us to meet our current and future expectations of the safety, correctness, security, efficiency etc. of the computing systems that we depend on.

The central goal of LiVe4CS is to

* i) promote new European research that tackles this vital problem by pushing recent fundamental scientific breakthroughs in advanced type systems from the academic world towards commercial adoption; and
* ii) promote new scientific breakthroughs needed to meet the future challenges that we face in deploying increasingly advanced computing systems.

This proposal brings together six leading European research groups who have international track record of research in verification, type systems, programming languages and compilers and eleven industries who have expertise in applications of typeful languages in order to produce unique, multidisciplinary and intersectoral training program to equip fifteen early career researchers with the required skills and entrepreneurship to develop programing languages of the next generation.
